# PORTFOLIO

This project was about creating my very own and first portfolio. My portfolio contains an image of me, a small introduction to myself, my current tech-skills, an overview of some of my Technigo projects, some thoughts on code (although content is not my own yet, this will be updated later) and my contact information. The project was also about doing cross browser testing and accessibility testing. 

## The problem

This project was not "supposed to be" that heavy on the tech side but I must admit that is has been a very great challenge to lay out the structure and then styling it. Since I will not take part in the career coaching programme I decided to not copy every design aspect from the Figma file. I am still very proud of the way my portfolio currently looks. I think it's a great start and I look forward to refining it along the course and as my programming skills deepen. 

If I had even more time to focus on this project I would put more effort into accessibility, something I didn't manage to really dig into (which I find sad because I do find this aspect to be of such a great importance). I have run my code through both the W3C Markup Validation Service and the one for CSS and they have both passed (I had a few expected errors in markup that I corrected). I have also looked at my code in the most common browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge and Firefox) and I think they look and function the same.
